# The Practice

The Practice is not a single file. It is the entire system of principles, structure, and tooling -- directives, rules, commands, agents, skills, quality gates, and the learning loop -- all working together to ensure quality, reverse entropy, and support innovation. `practice.md` is one small part of that whole.

## For Day-to-Day Work

Follow `.agent/directives/AGENT.md` and `.agent/directives/principles.md`. That is all you need for normal operations.

## The Practice Core Files

The Practice Core travels between repos as a package of seven required files. The three **plasmid trinity** files encode the blueprint; the **entry points** provide orientation; the **changelog** records what changed; the **provenance file** tracks evolution history. It may be accompanied by an optional `.agent/practice-context/` directory, but that directory is not part of the Core.

| File                                           | Role                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [practice.md](practice.md)                     | Blueprint: artefact map, workflow, three-layer model (the **what**)      |
| [practice-lineage.md](practice-lineage.md)     | Blueprint: principles, evolution rules, exchange mechanism (the **why**) |
| [practice-bootstrap.md](practice-bootstrap.md) | Blueprint: annotated templates for every artefact type (the **how**)     |
| [README.md](README.md)                         | Entry point for humans: context and hydration how-to                     |
| [index.md](index.md)                           | Entry point for agents: operational orientation (this file)              |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)                   | What changed: repo-tagged summaries for plasmid integration              |
| [provenance.yml](provenance.yml)               | Per-file evolution chains for the plasmid trinity                        |

The trinity files point to `provenance.yml` for their evolution history and evolve between repos. For day-to-day work you do not need to read any of these — they are the blueprint, not the building.

## Boundary Contract

The Practice Core files are **portable** — they travel between repos and must be self-contained. The one permitted external link is to `../practice-index.md`, a **local** bridge file that each repo creates during hydration. All other external paths appear as code-formatted text only.

|                | Portable (travels)               | Local (stays)                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Files**      | The seven Practice Core files    | `.agent/practice-index.md`     |
| **Links**      | Only to each other + the bridge  | To the repo's actual artefacts |
| **Created by** | Origin repo or prior propagation | Hydration step 8               |

## The Practice Box

The `incoming/` directory is the Practice Box. When Practice Core files arrive from another repo, they land here. Check it at session start (via `start-right`) and during consolidation. See the Integration Flow in `practice-lineage.md` for details.

If `.agent/practice-context/` exists, read `README.md` and `incoming/` as
received support during hydration or integration. `incoming/` is transient and
should be cleared after integration. Local `outgoing/` may persist.

If the local repo spans multiple agent platforms, maintain an explicit local
surface contract in `.agent/reference/cross-platform-agent-surface-matrix.md`
and expose it from `../practice-index.md`. Supported and unsupported states
should be written down explicitly rather than inferred from missing files.

## Cold Start -- Hydrating a New Repo

If `.agent/directives/AGENT.md` does not yet exist, you are hydrating the Practice for the first time.

**The key first step is to understand the repo.** Before creating any Practice artefacts, survey the existing repository: its intent, language(s), test framework, linter, formatter, package manager, build system, established norms, and existing quality standards. The Practice enables excellence; it does not replace what has already been achieved. Only once you understand the local ecosystem should you begin adapting the Practice to it.

If the Practice Core files have been placed somewhere other than `.agent/practice-core/` (e.g. the repo root, a random directory), move them to `.agent/practice-core/` first -- create the directory and an `incoming/.gitkeep` within it if needed.

Then follow the Growing a Practice section in [practice-lineage.md](practice-lineage.md). The templates in [practice-bootstrap.md](practice-bootstrap.md) provide artefact specifications -- adapt ALL templates to local tooling and conventions. The templates use TypeScript/Node.js as concrete examples; substitute your ecosystem's equivalents. As part of hydration, create `.agent/practice-index.md` -- the bridge file that carries navigable links to the local repo's artefacts (see the template in [practice-bootstrap.md](practice-bootstrap.md)). See the Bootstrap Checklist in [practice-bootstrap.md](practice-bootstrap.md) for validation.

If `.agent/practice-context/` exists, read `incoming/` before adapting the
Practice. It may contain useful framing from the sending repo.
