# Distilled Learnings

## Repo Preferences

- Keep canonical guidance in `.agent/`; adapters stay thin.
- Prefer deterministic fixtures and explicit validation seams.
- Use `tools/repo_audit.py` for tracked-file checks instead of forcing them into
  `pytest`.
- Prefer documented commands that match the managed runtime, for example
  `uv run python -m ...`, rather than assuming `python` is on `PATH`.
