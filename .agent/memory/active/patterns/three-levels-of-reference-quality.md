# Three Levels of Reference Quality

## Problem

Documentation and portable content references concepts from other
parts of a system. The reference can be opaque, descriptive, or
self-contained. Choosing the wrong level makes the content brittle
or unintelligible when it moves to a new context.

## The Three Levels

1. **Opaque pointer**: "See ADR-144." Requires the reader to have
   access to the host repo's specific artefact system. Fails completely
   in any other context.

2. **Descriptive name**: "The three-zone fitness model." Better —
   the reader knows what the concept is about. But if they have never
   encountered the concept, the name alone is insufficient. A pointer
   with a better label is still a pointer.

3. **Exported concept**: "The fitness model uses a four-zone scale —
   `healthy`, `soft`, `hard`, `critical` — where `critical` is
   `hard limit × 1.5`. `soft` is a refinement signal; `hard` blocks at
   consolidation closure; `critical` always blocks and triggers a
   loop-health post-mortem." The substance travels with the reference.
   The reader can act on it without access to the original source.

## Pattern

- **Internal references** (within the same repo, same team): Level 1
  is acceptable. The reader can follow the pointer.
- **Cross-team references** (same org, different repo): Level 2
  minimum. The reader may not have access to the source.
- **Portable content** (travels between repos, orgs, or contexts):
  Level 3 required. The content must carry its own meaning.

## When This Applies

- Practice Core and Context files that travel between repos
- READMEs that onboard contributors from different teams
- Architecture decision records that reference external standards
- Documentation that may outlive the artefacts it references
