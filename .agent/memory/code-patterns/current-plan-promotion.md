# Current Plan Promotion

## Principle

When a review or planning tranche settles the repo's real next implementation
step, promote that tranche into the live `current/` queue and make it safe to
start from cold. A plan is not truly current until it is both decision-ready
and session-entry-ready.

## Pattern

1. Record the decision and rationale in permanent documentation first.
2. Move the chosen tranche into the canonical `current/` collection if it has
   become the real next-up.
3. Add the plan scaffolding needed for a cold start:
   - explicit current status
   - session-entry checklist
   - decision contract
   - closure criteria
4. Update all queue and roadmap surfaces that describe the next-up ordering.
5. Update blocked downstream plans so they reference the promoted current plan
   rather than an obsolete future path.
6. Run the normal repo gate so the promotion lands as a coherent queue change,
   not just a file move.

## Anti-pattern

- Leaving the true next tranche under `future/` while READMEs describe it as
  current
- Treating a plan as ready merely because the direction is decided
- Promoting a next-up tranche without adding the entry checklist and closure
  contract the next session needs
- Moving one plan while leaving blocked downstream plans pointing at the old
  location

## When to Apply

Use this when a review, roadmap, or planning pass has resolved "what comes
next" and the repo now needs a concrete next-session entry point rather than a
mere intended future direction.
