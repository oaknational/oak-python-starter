# Plan-Body First-Principles Check

Before authoring tests, implementations, or doctrine prescribed by a plan body,
run the three-clause first-principles check. If any clause fails, surface the
mismatch to the owner before writing code or doctrine.

1. **Shape clause.** Is the test-shape (or implementation-shape, or doctrine-
   shape) right for the **repo-authored behaviour** being proven, or is it a
   vendor / configuration / framework assertion in disguise? If the shape
   proves "the vendor did its job" or "the config is set", the shape is wrong.
2. **Landing-path clause.** Does the file naming carry a tooling contract
   (pre-commit hook, CI gate inclusion/exclusion, lint config, test-runner
   include pattern) that constrains how or when this artefact can land? Silent
   mismatches produce dead tests, bypassed gates, or "lands-but-never-fires"
   artefacts.
3. **Vendor-literal clause.** Does any literal token taken from the plan body
   (especially vendor API values, config keys, package-export names, file
   paths) match the current upstream surface, or is it a doc-level word the
   plan borrowed? Plan prose drifts from vendor reality between plan-write and
   plan-execute.

This rule is the first-principles tripwire inside the perturbation-mechanism
bundle. It fires before implementation inherits a bad frame.

## Why this rule exists

The `inherited-framing-without-first-principles-check` pattern names a
repeated failure mode: the agent executes a plan's prescribed shape faithfully
because it is written down, without asking whether the shape is right for the
behaviour being proven. Six instances occurred across 2026-04-20 and 2026-
04-21; three were caught only by external friction (owner in-flight review,
reading spec against directive, cross-checking vendor docs) — not by any
pre-installed tripwire. Passive guidance did not fire.

This rule converts the check from passive guidance into an always-applied
trigger at shape-entry, per the `passive-guidance-loses-to-artefact-gravity`
pattern's Heath-brothers tripwire framing.
